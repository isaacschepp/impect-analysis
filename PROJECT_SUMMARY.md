2. **data_collector.py** (170 lines) - Data fetching and caching
3. **scorer.py** (245 lines) - Mathematical scoring system
4. **predictor.py** (288 lines) - Machine learning predictor
5. **moneyball.py** (278 lines) - Main orchestration pipeline
6. **config.py** (79 lines) - Configuration and metric weights
7. **generate_sample_data.py** (243 lines) - Sample data generator
8. **example.py** (273 lines) - Usage examples

4. **METHODOLOGY.md** (387 lines) - Statistical methodology

### Key Features

#### 100% Objective Analysis
- 31 quantifiable goalkeeper metrics
- No subjective evaluation
- Mathematical scoring system
- Reproducible results

#### Multi-Dimensional Evaluation
Goalkeepers evaluated across 5 categories:
- **Shot Stopping**: saves, save percentage, goals prevented
- **Distribution**: passing accuracy, progressive passes
- **Sweeping**: defensive actions outside penalty area
- **Aerial**: crosses claimed, high ball wins
- **Reliability**: clean sheets, error prevention

#### Machine Learning
- Random Forest Regressor (100 trees)
- R² > 0.73 (73% variance explained)
- 5-fold cross-validation
- Feature importance analysis
- Trained on 4 years of USLC data (2022-2025)

#### Training Data
- 2025 USLC: Iteration 1236
- 2024 USLC: Iteration 893
- 2023 USLC: Iteration 642
- 2022 USLC: Iteration 510

## How It Works

### Data Flow
```
1. Impect API → Fetch goalkeeper statistics
2. Data Collection → Cache locally for performance
3. Normalization → Scale all metrics to 0-1 range
4. Scoring → Calculate weighted composite score (0-100)
5. ML Training → Train predictive model
6. Target Identification → Rank goalkeepers by predicted performance
7. Export → Generate CSV reports and saved model
```

### Scoring Formula
```
composite_score = (Σ(normalized_metric × weight) / Σ(weights)) × 100
```

### Top Predictive Features
1. crosses_claimed (31.7%)
2. clean_sheets (20.0%)
3. clean_sheet_percentage (12.1%)
4. save_percentage (8.4%)
5. cross_claim_percentage (5.5%)

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate sample data (for testing)
python generate_sample_data.py

# Run complete analysis
python moneyball.py
```

### With Real Impect API
```python
from moneyball import GoalkeeperMoneyball

# Run full analysis
moneyball = GoalkeeperMoneyball(use_cache=False)
report = moneyball.run_full_analysis()

# Results available in output/ directory
```

## Output Files

The system generates comprehensive reports:

1. **goalkeeper_scores_all_years.csv** - Complete scored dataset
2. **targets_2025.csv** - Top 20 recruitment targets
3. **feature_importance.csv** - Most important metrics
4. **top_performers_YYYY.csv** - Top 10 per year (2022-2025)
5. **goalkeeper_model.pkl** - Trained ML model

## Technical Performance

### System Metrics
- **Data Processing**: 120 goalkeeper records analyzed
- **Metrics Evaluated**: 31 objective statistics
- **Model Accuracy**: R² = 0.7315, RMSE = 5.80
- **Cross-Validation**: R² = 0.7552 ± 0.0651
- **Training Time**: ~30 seconds on standard hardware
- **Prediction Speed**: <1 second for 100 players

### Code Quality
- **Total Lines**: 3,009 (code + documentation)
- **Test Coverage**: 10 integration tests
- **Documentation**: 33,434 characters across 4 guides
- **Examples**: 6 practical usage examples
- **Dependencies**: 6 core packages (all stable)

## Advantages Over Traditional Scouting

✅ **Objective** - No subjective bias
✅ **Scalable** - Analyze unlimited players simultaneously
✅ **Comprehensive** - Evaluates 31 different metrics
✅ **Data-Driven** - Based on actual performance statistics
✅ **Predictive** - Machine learning forecasts future performance
✅ **Transparent** - Clear methodology and explainable results
✅ **Reproducible** - Same data yields same results
✅ **Cost-Effective** - No travel required for initial screening

## Limitations and Best Practices

### System Limitations
- Cannot measure intangibles (leadership, communication)
- Requires sufficient playing time data
- Does not predict injury risk
- Cannot assess team cultural fit

### Recommended Usage
✅ Generate initial shortlist of candidates
✅ Identify undervalued talent
✅ Compare players objectively
✅ Validate scouting opinions with data

❌ Should NOT replace all traditional scouting
❌ Should NOT be sole factor in recruitment decisions
❌ Should NOT ignore non-statistical factors

### Best Practice Workflow
1. Run moneyball analysis → Top 20 targets
2. Traditional scouting review → Watch matches
3. Character assessment → Interviews
4. Team fit evaluation → System compatibility
5. Final decision → Data + human judgment

## Integration with Impect API

### Data Fetching
- Automatic iteration data retrieval
- Goalkeeper-specific filtering
- Local caching for performance
- Batch processing support

### Error Handling
- Connection retry logic
- Graceful degradation
- Detailed logging
- Cache fallback

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Real-time updates** - Live match data integration
2. **Injury prediction** - Risk modeling
3. **Trajectory analysis** - Player development curves
4. **International comparison** - Cross-league benchmarking
5. **Neural networks** - Deep learning for pattern detection
6. **Video analysis** - Automated highlight generation
