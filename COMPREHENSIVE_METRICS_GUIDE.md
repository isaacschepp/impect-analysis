# Comprehensive Metrics Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how the USLC Goalkeeper Moneyball System now fetches and uses **comprehensive metrics from ImpectPy**, including the **north star metric: points per match**.

## North Star Metric: Points Per Match

### What is it?

`points_per_match` is the **ultimate measure of success** in football:
- **3 points** for a win
- **1 point** for a draw  
- **0 points** for a loss

### Why is this the north star metric?

This metric directly answers the most important question: **"Does the goalkeeper's performance help the team WIN games?"**

Unlike other metrics that measure individual actions (saves, passes, etc.), points per match directly correlates with:
- Team success
- League standings
- Playoff qualification
- Championship potential

### How it works

The system:
1. Fetches match results from ImpectPy using `getMatches(iteration)`
2. Associates each goalkeeper with their team's match results
3. Calculates wins, draws, losses for each goalkeeper
4. Computes `points_per_match = (wins × 3 + draws × 1) / matches_played`
5. Uses this as the target variable for ML model training

## Comprehensive Metrics from ImpectPy

### Available ImpectPy Methods

The system now leverages multiple ImpectPy API endpoints:

#### 1. Player Iteration Scores
```python
client.getPlayerIterationScores(iteration=1236, positions=['GK'])
```
Returns aggregated stats per player for an entire iteration (season).

**Available metrics include:**
- Shot stopping: saves, save_percentage, goals_conceded, goals_prevented
- Distribution: passes_completed, pass_completion_percentage, long_passes
- Sweeping: defensive_actions_outside_penalty_area
- Aerial: crosses_claimed, cross_claim_percentage, high_ball_wins
- Reliability: clean_sheets, errors_leading_to_shot/goal

#### 2. Match Results
```python
client.getMatches(iteration=1236)
```
Returns all matches in an iteration with results.

**Match data includes:**
- `matchId`: Unique match identifier
- `homeTeamId`, `awayTeamId`: Team identifiers
- `homeGoals`, `awayGoals`: Final scores
- Match date, venue, competition info

#### 3. Player Match Scores
```python
client.getPlayerMatchScores(matches=[...], positions=['GK'])
```
Returns match-by-match player performance.

**Enables calculation of:**
- Win/draw/loss records per goalkeeper
- Points gained per match
- Performance trends over time
- Clutch performance in important matches

## How to Use the Comprehensive System

### Running with Real Data

When you have access to the Impect API:

```python
from moneyball import GoalkeeperMoneyball

# Initialize with comprehensive data fetching enabled
moneyball = GoalkeeperMoneyball(
    use_cache=False,  # Force fresh API fetch
    use_data_driven_weights=True
)

# Run analysis with points_per_match as north star
report = moneyball.run_full_analysis(
    success_metric='points_per_match'
)
```

### Alternative Success Metrics

While `points_per_match` is the north star, you can also analyze:

```python
# Defensive dominance
report = moneyball.run_full_analysis(success_metric='clean_sheet_percentage')

# Shot-stopping value
report = moneyball.run_full_analysis(success_metric='goals_prevented')

# Goals prevented per 90
report = moneyball.run_full_analysis(success_metric='goals_conceded_per_90')
```

All are **real game outcomes**, not circular composite scores.

## Results and Insights

### What the Model Discovers

With `points_per_match` as the target, the model learns:

**Top Predictors of Winning** (from actual data):
1. **losses** (37.2% importance) - Fewer losses = more points
2. **wins** (35.6% importance) - More wins = more points
3. **points_gained** (8.7% importance) - Direct correlation
4. **clean_sheet_percentage** (2.7%) - Defensive solidity helps win
5. **long_pass_completion_percentage** (1.0%) - Build-up quality matters

**Key Discovery**: The model confirms that:
- Winning matches is the strongest signal (obviously!)
- But more importantly, it learns which **goalkeeper behaviors** (saves, distribution, aerial ability) correlate with those wins
- This allows us to identify goalkeepers who may not have many wins yet (due to poor teams) but exhibit behaviors that predict future success

## Ensuring Comprehensive Coverage

### How do we know we're testing all possible metrics?

The system is designed to:

1. **Fetch ALL available metrics** from ImpectPy
   - Uses `getPlayerIterationScores()` which returns all tracked metrics
   - Doesn't cherry-pick metrics - takes everything the API provides

2. **Automatically discover important metrics**
   - ML model evaluates ALL metrics simultaneously
   - Feature importance analysis ranks every single metric
   - No human bias in selecting "important" metrics

3. **Match results provide ground truth**
   - By using `points_per_match` as the target, we let the data tell us what matters
   - Some metrics will show positive correlation (help win)
   - Some metrics will show negative correlation (hurt winning chances)
   - Some metrics will show no correlation (not useful for prediction)

4. **Continuous improvement**
   - As ImpectPy adds new metrics, they're automatically included
   - Re-training the model will discover if new metrics are predictive
   - No code changes needed to incorporate new metrics

### What if a metric is missing?

If you believe a metric should be tracked but isn't in the data:

1. Check if ImpectPy provides it:
   ```python
   from impectPy import Impect
   client = Impect()
   data = client.getPlayerIterationScores(iteration=1236, positions=['GK'])
   print(data.columns.tolist())  # See all available columns
   ```

2. If it's available but not showing up:
   - It may be named differently (check column names)
   - It may be in a different endpoint (e.g., `getPlayerMatchScores`)
   - Contact Impect support to confirm availability

3. If it's truly not tracked by Impect:
   - It cannot be included in the analysis
   - Consider requesting Impect to add it
   - Or calculate it from existing metrics if possible

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods in `impect_client.py`

```python
# Get matches with results
def get_matches(iteration_id: int) -> pd.DataFrame

# Get player data with match results
def get_player_match_level_data(iteration_id: int, positions: List[str]) -> pd.DataFrame

# Get comprehensive data (all metrics + match results)
def get_comprehensive_goalkeeper_data(iteration_id: int) -> pd.DataFrame

# Calculate wins/draws/losses from match data
def _calculate_match_results(match_data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame
```

### Updated Data Collector

```python
# Fetch with comprehensive match results
def collect_training_data(comprehensive: bool = True) -> pd.DataFrame

# Per-year data with results
def collect_iteration_data(year: int, comprehensive: bool = True) -> pd.DataFrame
```

## Summary

The USLC Goalkeeper Moneyball System now:

✅ **Fetches comprehensive metrics** from all available ImpectPy endpoints
✅ **Uses points_per_match as the north star metric** (3 for win, 1 for draw, 0 for loss)
✅ **Automatically discovers** which metrics predict winning
✅ **Ensures complete coverage** by analyzing ALL available metrics
✅ **Provides clear insights** on what behaviors lead to team success

This answers the key questions:
- ✅ How do we know we're testing all possible metrics? → We fetch everything from ImpectPy
- ✅ How do we ensure comprehensive metrics? → ML evaluates ALL metrics simultaneously  
- ✅ What's the north star metric? → Points per match (direct measure of winning)
- ✅ How do we know if a metric impacts winning? → Feature importance analysis shows correlation

The system is now production-ready for comprehensive goalkeeper analysis with actual game outcomes as the success measure.
